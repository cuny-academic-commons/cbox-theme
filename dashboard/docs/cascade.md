## Cascading Assets: Overview

Maintaining a large portfolio of themes, particularly in multi-site environments
can quickly become cumbersome and repetitive. Infinity's cascading architecture
makes managing template inheritance easy, but with assets tightly bound to their
theme's templates with static paths you may be forced to duplicate templates
for minor path differences.

In some cases you may want to have several "master" themes, each of which has
several child themes which only differ in their styles and content. You need the
flexibility to override some or all of their parent theme's assets without having
to duplicate the templates.

This is where cascading assets comes in. Another powerful Infinity innovation which allows
extreme control over your theme hierarchy.
