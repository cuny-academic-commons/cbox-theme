## Introduction

The Infinity Base Theme is a great starting point for any type of WordPress project
(it's also developed with MultiSite networks, BuddyPress and BBPress in mind).
It also serves as the go-to example which shows off Infinity's powerful set of features.

The base theme has been developed using the latest WordPress Theming standards using
template parts, hooks and a flexible CSS Grid so you can use it easily as the parent
theme for your projects. 

In this section we'll give you a detailed overview of how to get started with the theme,
and how you can use it for a wide range of WordPress projects for either your clients or
commercial (theme) sales.
