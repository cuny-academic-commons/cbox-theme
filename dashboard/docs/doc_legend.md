## Legend

Throughout this documentation there are a few formatting styles used.
This legend serves to eliminate any confusion, just in case!

### Highlighting

> This is some highlighted text used to get your attention.
If you don't read it you may miss a cool tip, fall victim to a common "gotcha"
or miss an important step.

### Code

We try to provide actual code examples when applicable. There are two types of code that
have special formatting in the documentation.

#### INI File Directives

Here are some .ini directives.

	[section_one]
	item_a = 1;
	item_b = on;
	item_c = "Hello there"

#### PHP Code

Here is some valid PHP code.

	<?php
		while ( $a == $b ) {
			print 'A is the same as B, its Miller Time';
		}
	?>
